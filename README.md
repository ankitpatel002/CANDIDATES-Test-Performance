 Unveiling My Latest Power BI Dashboard: CANDIDATES Test Performance Insights! 

I'm excited to share my latest Power BI project—a CANDIDATES Test Performance Insights Dashboard—designed to analyze and track candidate test performance efficiently. This dashboard provides in-depth analytics on test completions, candidate scores, and section-wise performance, helping recruiters and hiring teams make data-driven decisions.

-> Key Features & KPIs:

 1. Total Candidates & Test Completion – Monitors the number of candidates and test completions.
 2. Average Time Taken & Candidate Score – Tracks the average test duration and performance.
 3. Window Violation Monitoring – Ensures test integrity by tracking violations.
 4. Candidate Trends – Yearly and monthly breakdown of candidate participation.
 5. Candidate Category Performance – Classifies candidates into Beginner, Intermediate, Experienced, and Proficient.
 6. Feedback Analysis – Assesses feedback with categories like Great, Neutral, and Not Good.
 7. Test Type Analysis – Evaluates participation across different test types (e.g., MBA Interns, AWS Cloud Architect).
 8. Top & Bottom Performing Sections – Highlights the highest and lowest scoring test sections.
 9. Daily Breakdown of Candidates – Displays test participation trends over the week.
10. Top Performers – Identifies candidates with the highest scores.

-> Why This Dashboard?

-> This dashboard enhances hiring and recruitment decisions by:
1. Providing a clear overview of test completion trends.
2. Identifying strong and weak candidates based on performance.
3. Tracking test integrity with window violation monitoring.
4. Enabling recruiters to refine candidate selection.
